Usage

Once loaded in your calculator, run it by typing <code>memory(int)</code> with <code>intt</code> being an integer less than or equal to 12. The paramenter <code>int</code> is the number of digits in the number that will float around the screen for a few seconds, and then a screen will prompt you to recall the number. If you can, you win. If not, you lose. It will then ask you if you want to play again. This is just a fun little project.
